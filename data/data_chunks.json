        "text": "Velvet bean–Mucuna pruriens var. utilis, also known as mucuna—is a twining annual leguminous vine common to most parts of the tropics. Its growth is restricted to the wet-season as it dies at the onset of the cold season. It has large trifoliate leaves (i.e. has three leaflets) and very long vigorous twining stems that can extend over two–three metres depending on growth conditions. When planted at the beginning of the growing season, flowers normally form at the end of March/early April. These flowers are deep purple and appear underneath the foliage. Seeds are large, ovoid shaped (±10 mm long) and of different colours, ranging from white, grey, brown to black and mottled."

        "text": "The velvet bean can be grown for soil fertility, green manure and as a cover crop in conservation agriculture (CA). The velvet bean is a high yielding leguminous forage crop—high in nitrogen (N)/crude protein content. It is usually sown as an N-fixing ley crop or as a green manure crop to improve soil fertility. In the sub-humid regions it can be intercropped with maize to improve soil fertility, maximize grain/herbage yields per unit area and provide mixed crop for hay/silage making. Whether it is grown as a single or mixed crop, the velvet bean provides early dry season grazing or fodder for hay or mixed-crop silage, improving the N content of cereal or grass silage."

        "text": "The hay and silage can be used as supplementary feed during the dry season to improve the digestibility of poor quality roughages, such as maize stover. Mucuna is a prolific seeder and its seed (26% crude protein) can be used in home-mixed rations to replace commercial supplements. However, its grain is not so useful to non-ruminant livestock. It can only be used for human consumption after reducing its toxicity by boiling and discarding the water several times."

        "text": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU."

        "text": "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory and gated recurrent neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures. Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples."

        "text": "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences. In all but a few cases, however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network. In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs."
